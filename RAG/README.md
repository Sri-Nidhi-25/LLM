So `script.py` file can read the cat facts and state it back.. But each time the chunks get loaded from the beginning... 
Hence `index.py` and `ask.py` were given birth.. 
Now I wanted the same model to ingest data from diffrent files and answer about them together compare and contrast and all.. so `multi-index.py` and `multi-ask.py` 
next - "cats and dogs" and "dogs and cats" seem to be totally 2 diiferent things..
