# ✅ What You Have Already Completed (From This Article)

Based on what you told me earlier, you’ve implemented:

### 1️⃣ Multi-document support

✔ Originally: single doc
✔ You: multiple docs in vector store

---

### 2️⃣ Multi-topic handling (basic level)

✔ You improved threshold tuning
✔ You allowed more flexible semantic matching
✔ You reduced word-order sensitivity ("cats and dogs" ≈ "dogs and cats")

So you partially addressed this limitation:

> “If the question covers multiple topics, the system may not answer well.”

But:

* You improved similarity behavior
* You did NOT implement multi-query retrieval or query rewriting yet (unless you didn’t mention it)

So this is **partially completed**, not fully.

---

### 3️⃣ Better similarity tuning

✔ Adjusted threshold
✔ Improved semantic matching

This addresses:

> “Top N results based only on cosine similarity may not always be best.”

But you have NOT added:

* Re-ranking model
* Hybrid search
* Cross-encoder reranker

So this is **partially improved**, but not architecturally upgraded.

---

### 4️⃣ Still In-Memory Database

❌ You are still using in-memory vector storage (based on original tutorial).

Not yet implemented:

* Qdrant
* Pinecone
* pgvector
* FAISS persistent storage

So scalability improvement is still pending.

---

### 5️⃣ Chunking Strategy

Article says:

> “Each sentence is a chunk.”

If you did not change this, then:

❌ Still basic sentence-level chunking
❌ No overlap
❌ No semantic chunking
❌ No metadata-aware chunking

So chunking improvement is still open.

---

### 6️⃣ Model Size Upgrade

Article says:

> “We use a small 1B model.”

If you're still using that:
❌ Not upgraded

If you changed to a stronger LLM:
✔ Then that’s done.

# 🧠 Important: Core Improvements vs Advanced Variants

There are two categories here.

---

# Category 1: Core RAG Improvements (You SHOULD Do)

These are practical, production-relevant:

1. Multi-query retrieval
2. Reranking
3. Better chunking
4. Persistent vector DB
5. Evaluation metrics
6. Source attribution

These make you job-ready.

---

# Category 2: Research-Level Variants (Optional for Now)

These are more experimental:

* Graph RAG
* Hybrid KG + Vector RAG
* Modular RAG with routing
* Branching RAG
* Looping RAG pipelines

These are impressive but not necessary for your current project.

---

# 🎯 What’s Actually Left From This Article?

From this article alone, the unfinished items are:

### 🔴 Major Missing

* Query rewriting / multi-query retrieval
* Reranking model
* Scalable vector database
* Better chunking strategy

### 🟡 Optional but Mentioned

* Larger model

### 🔵 Separate Advanced Topics

* Graph RAG
* Hybrid RAG (KG + Vector)
* Modular RAG

---

# 🏆 What Should You Finish Before Moving On?

For an LLM engineer portfolio, I recommend you finish:

1. ✅ Multi-query rewriting (LLM generates better search query)
2. ✅ Add reranker
3. ✅ Improve chunking
4. ✅ Use real vector DB (Qdrant or pgvector)
5. ✅ Add evaluation script

If you do these, you’ve exhausted this article at a serious level.

---

# 🔎 Reality Check

Right now your project is:

> Enhanced tutorial-level RAG

If you add reranking + evaluation:

It becomes:

> Retrieval-optimized RAG system

That’s a massive jump in perceived skill.
